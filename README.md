# Deal Size Classification using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to classify deal sizes (Small, Medium, Large) based on order information.

The workflow includes data cleaning, feature selection, encoding categorical variables, training a classification model, and evaluating its performance.

## Model Used

* Decision Tree Classifier

## Features Used

* QUANTITYORDERED
* PRICEEACH
* PRODUCTLINE
* COUNTRY

## Target

* DEALSIZE (Small, Medium, Large)

## Tools and Libraries

* Python
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* LabelEncoder
* DecisionTreeClassifier

## Workflow

1. Load and clean the dataset
2. Select relevant features
3. Encode categorical variables
4. Split the data into training and testing sets
5. Train a Decision Tree classifier
6. Evaluate model accuracy
7. Predict deal size for new orders

## Result

* Model accuracy: ~86% on the test set
